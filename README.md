This is my own spice simulator. To use just type `python3.8 MNA.py <networkname>` where networkname is the name of the circuit file. It then shows the first current as a graph. Note that the sign of the current may be switched. Negative current means that the current is going from the voltage source and positive current means that the current is going "into" the voltage source.
